<h2>What is LibertyAxes?</h2>
	<p>LibertyAxes is a political quiz specifically aimed at those aligned with classical liberalism, libertarianism, or other similar ideologies. This test will attempt to place you on 8 seperate axes representing varying opinions & differences within classical liberal & libertarian movements, through answering a series of questions.<br /><br />
	There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>
<hr>

<h2>What are the values?</h2>
  <p>There are currently eight axes, each of which has two opposing values. They are:</p><br/>
	
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#fdfd00;">Anarchy</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#1c4aea;">Minarchy</b><br/>
	        Those with higher Anarchy scores support rejecting the state and leading it to its logical conclusion, the elimination of it. Those with higher Minarchy scores believe libertarianism is compatible with the state, and typically believe it is nessecary to protect individual rights.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#49db0b;">Progressive</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#bd5be5;">Traditional</b><br/>
	        Those with higher Progressive scores align with cultural liberalism, and tend to social justice and a focus on the socially disadvantaged. Those with higher Traditionalist scores align with more conservative-leaning viewpoints, and tend to support social authority within family, church and local communities, as opposed to the state.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#e92e9c;">Regulated</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#fcc52b;">Markets</b><br/>
	        Those with higher Regulated scores believe laissez-faire economic models are unrealistic, and that some degree of minimal state economic intervention is necessary, whether to prevent monopolies. Those with higher Laissez-Faire scores believe that most, if not all forms of economic intervention by the state infringes on liberty or is detrimental to the economy in other ways.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#edef22;">Property</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#0ed145;">Georgist</b><br/>
	        Those with higher Property scores believe that land ownership should be undistributed, and are often in favour of rent, landlords and propertarianism. Those with higher Georgism scores believe that land should be considered a common asset, are typically supportive to the idea land value tax.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#3fce11;">Austere</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#ff00a0;">Social</b><br/>
		Those with higher Austere scores believe social spending should be cut, either with the intention reducing debt & taxes or to reduce society's reliance on the state. Those with higher Social scores believe social spending should be increased, with the intention often being to reduce economic inequality or to ensure equality of opportunity.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#008000;">Isolation</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#004489;">Intervention</b><br/>
	        Those with higher Isolation scores believe foreign conflicts and issues that don't directly affect the nation are not worth worrying about nor participating in, often in support of a neutral or pacifistic foreign policy. Those with higher Intervention scores believe liberty should be spread around the globe in places where it is limited, often via force.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#03a9f4;">Democratic</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#9200c1;">Anti-Electoral</b><br/>
	        Those with higher Democratic values believe democracy as a fundamental libertarian value, often supporting the expansion of democratic systems through various methods, most notably direct democracy. Those with higher Anti-Electoral values tend to be more skeptical of the democratic process, often outright rejecting it in favour of alternative systems, such as monarchy or forms of anarchy.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#e791ab;">Reform</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#fe0010;">Revolution</b><br/>
		Those with higher Reform scores believe that gradual reform within already-existing systems is the most preferable option to achieve libertarian goals. Those with higher Revolution scores believe that direct action is the most preferable option to achieve libertarian goals, often believing violence is necessary to do so.</p>
